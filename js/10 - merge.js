// merge(arr1, arr2)
//
// Write a function called merge. The function should
// take two sorted arrays of numbers as input and return
// a merged array of the sorted numbers from the input.
// For example, if the input arrays were
// var arr1 = [3,6,11]; var arr2 = [2,4,5,8,9];
// Then the returned array would be: [2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11].
